# Learned

In this challenge I was able to gain a better understanding of React and how to develop a single page web app. The understanding of routing was a challenge in getting started with this project, but once I was able to grasp that it became easier to figure out how to start making components. I hope to continue with this as a good base to work on my front end development skills.
